## Introduction

This document is a technical specification of the Appsolu project. It is a description of the project's architecture and the technologies used. It is also a description of the project's development process.

## Architecture

### General architecture

The project is divided into two parts: the LoRa-E5 Dev board and the communication. The board is programmed using tinygo, and the communication protocol we are using is LoRa.

### Board

The board is composed of two parts: the LoRa-E5 Dev board and the communication. The board is programmed using tinygo, and the communication protocol we are using is LoRa.

#### LoRa-E5 Dev board

The LoRa-E5 Dev board is a LoRa board with a Cortex-M4 microcontroller. It is a development board for the Semtech SX126X LoRa transceiver. It has a STM32L073RZ microcontroller. It is programmed using tinygo.

#### Communication

The communication protocol we are using is LoRa. We are using the Semtech SX126X LoRa transceiver. The communication is done using the LoRa-E5 Dev board. The communication is done using the LoRa-E5 Dev board. The communication is done using the LoRa-E5 Dev board. The communication is done using the LoRa-E5 Dev board.
