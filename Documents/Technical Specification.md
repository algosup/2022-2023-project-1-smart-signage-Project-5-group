# 1. Introduction

## 1.a. Overview

The problem is that luminous signage is consuming a lot of energy and in case of a issue, it is hard to know where the problem is. It also takes time to fix the problem. The solution is to create a system that will allow to monitor luminous signage and to diagnose the problem in order to fix it in a fast way.

## 1.b. Glossary

### TinyGo

    TinyGo is a Go compiler for small places. It compiles Go programs to WebAssembly, microcontrollers, and command-line tools.

### LoRa-E5 Developpement board

    LoRa-E5 Dev board is a LoRaWAN development board based on the Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver and the STM32WL55JC microcontroller. It will have our code in it and will be used for the communication between the luminous signage and the things network.


### The Things Network

    The Things Network is a global community building an open-source LoRaWAN network. It is a non-profit organization that provides a global, decentralized, open-source LoRaWAN network.

### LoRaWAN

    LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks. It is designed to allow low-power communication between battery-powered devices over long range wireless connections.

## 1.c. Context

The problem is worth solving because energy consumtion is a big problem in the world. It is also a problem for the environment. It also make it faster to fix the problem resulting in a better reputation for the company.

## 1.d. Goals

    As a user, I want to be able to monitor the luminous signage in order to know if it is working or not.

    As a user, I want to be able to switch on and off the luminous signage in order to save energy.

    As a user, I want to be able to change the brightness of the luminous signage in order to save energy.

    As a user, I want to be able to know if the luminous signage is not behaving as intended in order to prevent damage.
