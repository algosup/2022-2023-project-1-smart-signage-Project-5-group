# Overview

SignAll is a company which manufacture luminous signage for companies. They want us to create a new device named Appsolu. This device will make their signage smart by being connected.

This functional specification is not completed yet.

# Scenarios

**Scenario 1 : Alban**

Alban is in charge of knowing if luminous signage of every restaurant of his brand in France are working. He used to send teams of technicians when the owner of one of his restaurant signaled a problem. The problem is that it could take weeks to fix a signage and it would damage the image of the brand. 
Thanks to Appsolu, he will be able to check in real time if a signage need to be fix and send a team on it more quickly.

**Scenario 2 : Mike**

Mike is the owner of a restaurant from a famous fast-food brand. Concerned by the environnement concerns, he would like to be able to switch off the lights when his restaurant is not open and be able to check his energy consumption. It will allows him to make financial savings and have a better reputation. 
Thanks to Appsolu, he will be able to switch off and on the lights in a much easier way than before. He will also be able to check his energy consumption and reduce the power gave to the led to save energy.

**Scenario 3 : Mike**

The same Mike would like that, also for a matter of energy saving, the power gave to the LEDs reduce when the outside luminosity is lower than usual, during night, bad weather or eclipse.
Thanks to Appsolu, some captors will be able to recognize a drop of luminosity and adapt the power gave to the LEDs.

# Non goals

This version will **not** support these features:

 - An user-friendly interface

## LEDs monitoring

It will allow the user to check if the LEDs are on, off or if they are broken

## Compliance with laws

Thanks to this functionality, the user will be sure that the usage of the signage will be in phase with environmental and ecological laws.

## Auto brightness

This feature will ensure that the brightness of the signage will adapt automatically in function of the ambiant luminosity

## Money savings

When the price of energy will increase, the signage will be able to reduce his energy consumption to ensure that the user is not overpaying
